## Image processing function, several instances will run in parallel
# It is just defined as a free function here to emphasize the fact that class member data will not be shared anyway
# across the workers.  NOTE: Do not attempt to use jevois.sendSerial() or any other functions of module jevois here, it
# will not work because computefunc() is running in a completely different process than jevois-daemon is. Just return
# any strings you wish to send out, and let your process() or processNoUSB() function do the sendSerial() instead.
def computefunc(inimggray, th1, th2):
    return cv2.Canny(inimggray, threshold1 = th1, threshold2 = th2, apertureSize = 3, L2gradient = False)

## Simple example of parallel image processing using OpenCV in Python on JeVois
#
# This module by default simply converts the input image to a grayscale OpenCV image, and then applies the Canny edge
# detection algorithm, 4 times running in parallel with 4 different edge coarseness settings. The resulting image is
# simply the 4 horizontally stacked results from the 4 parallel runs. Try to edit it to do something else!
#
# True multi-threaded processing is not supported by Python (the python \b threading module does not allow concurrent
# execution of several threads of python code). Parallel processing is somewhat feasible using the \b mutiprocessing
# python module, which is a process-based multiprocessing approach. Note that there are significant costs to
# parallelizing code over multiple processes, the main one being that data needs to be transferred back and forth
# between processes, using pipes, sockets, or other mechanisms. For machine vision, this is a significant problem as the
# amount of data (streaming video) that needs to be packaged, transferred, and unpacked is high. C++ is the preferred
# way of developping multi-threaded JeVois modules, where std::async() makes multi-threaded programming easy.
#
# \fixme <b>You should consider this module highly experimental and buggy!</b> This module is currently not working well
# when running with USB output. There is some internal issue with using the Python \b multiprocessing module in
# JeVois. Just creating a python process pool interferes with our USB video output driver, even if we simply create the
# pool and destroy it immediately without using it at all. Once the python process pool has been created, any subsequent
# attempt to change video format will fail with a video buffer allocation error. This module may still be useful for
# robotics applications where parallel python processing is needed but no video output to USB is necessary).
#
# \fixme This module is hence not enabled by default. You need to edit <b>JEVOIS:/config/videomappings.cfg</b>, and
# uncomment the line with \jvmod{PythonParallel} in it, to enable it.
#
# \fixme Conflated with this problem is the fact that guvcview sometimes, when it starts, turns streaming on, then grabs
# only 5 frames, then stream off, then set same video format again, and then stream on again. We are not sure why
# guvcview is doing this, however, this breaks this module since the second streamon fails as it is unable to allocate
# video buffers.
#
# Using this module
# -----------------
#
# One way we have been able to use this module with USB video outputs is: start `guvcview -f yuyv -x 352x288` (launches
# \jvmod{PythonSandbox}), then use the pull-down menu to select 1280x240 (switches to \jvmod{PythonParallel})
#
# This module is best used with no USB video outputs. Connect to JeVois over serial and issue:
# \verbatim
# setpar serout USB # to get text results through serial-over-USB, or use Hard if you want results on the 4-pin serial
# setpar serlog USB # to get log messages through serial-over-USB, or use Hard if you want them on the 4-pin serial
# setmapping2 YUYV 320 240 25.0 JeVois PythonParallel
# streamon
# \endverbatim
#
# As noted above, once you have loaded this module, any later attempts to change format again will fail.
#

class PythonParallel:
    # NOTE: Do not use a constructor in python multiprocessing JeVois modules, as it would be executed several times, in
    # each spawned worker process. Just do everything in the process() and/or processNoUSB() functions instead. Since
    # python allows runtime creation of new class data members, you can simply check whether they already exist, and, if
    # not, create them as new data members of the JeVois module.
